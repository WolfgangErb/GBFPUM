Description of the Code
-----------------------

The package contains several *Matlab* scripts and functions for the generation of a partition of unity on graphs

- The main *Matlab* folder contains example scripts and demos on how to use GBFPUM for the interpolation and regression of graph signals. 


The example scripts can be divided into two categories:

- The files of the form **example.m** are used to demonstrate how GBFs can be used for the interpolation of graph signals and how GBFs compare to bandlimited interpolation.
